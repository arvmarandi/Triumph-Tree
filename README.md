# Triumph Tree

Triumph Tree addresses a common issue faced by many; the inability to track and achieve one's goals. Most goal-tracking apps lack a visually tangible way for users to observe their progress. Our unique solution introdues an in-app sprite that visibly grows alongside users as they accomplish their goals, providing a clear and satisfying representation of their progress.

In Triumph Tree, users can define their goal and track their progress over time, ensuring they stay on the path to success. The in-app sprite provides a visual representation of their journey, making progress clear and engaging. Triumph Tree allows users to maintain multiple goals at once, and users can change their goal configurations at any time.

This application revolutionizes the way individuals track and follow their objectives, making goal achievement more engaging and motivating, helping users stay commited to their goals and reducing the risk of goal abandonment.
